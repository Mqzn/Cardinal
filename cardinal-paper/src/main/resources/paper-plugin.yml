dependencies:
  bootstrap:
  # Let's say that RegistryPlugin registers some data that your plugin needs to use
  # We don't need this during runtime, so it's not required in the server section.
  # However, can be added to both if needed
  #RegistryPlugin:
  #load: BEFORE
  #required: true
  #join-classpath: true # Defaults to true
  server:
    MineAbyssLib:
      load: BEFORE
      required: true
    PlaceholderAPI:
      # Load order is relative to the dependency. So here PlaceholderAPI loads before our plugin.
      load: BEFORE
      required: false
  # Add a required "RequiredPlugin" dependency, which will load AFTER your plugin.
  #RequiredPlugin:
  #load: AFTER
  #required: true
  # This means that your plugin will not have access to their classpath
  #join-classpath: false
